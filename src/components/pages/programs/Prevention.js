              First Call for Families was launched in 2021 to provide support to families before Department of Family and Children Services files a petition in dependency court. Recognizing that removal of a child is a traumatic event for the entire family, and that it can often be prevented with the right peer support, safety planning, or legal counsel, DAC established this prevention services team to help keep families together. To date, we have helped hundreds of parents and caregivers in Santa Clara County navigate investigations and mitigate risk factors affecting their children’s safety and wellbeing.</p>

              <p className='copy'>In order to maximize our impact, we utilize an interdisciplinary team of attorneys, social workers, and mentor parents.</p>

              <p className='copy copy-bold'>First Call provides three different types of services:</p>
              
              <p className='copy'>The <span className='copy-bold'>Warm Line</span> is a toll-free phone number for families to call for support, basic advice, and/or referrals within the community. Through <span className='copy-bold'>Know Your Rights Presentation</span>, the First Call team provides information to families about their rights and responsibilities before, during, and after the removal of a child by CPS. Finally, First Call may also provide more <span className='copy-bold'>individualized support</span> for families who require more intensive, wraparound support than our other services provide. This may include services such as peer support, case management, and legal advice before a court case begins.</p>
              <div className='first-call-hours'>
                <p className='first-call-copy copy'>To inquire about any of these services, or to refer a family, please give us a call at our warm line number:</p>
